At the moment, our work flow is simple (this may change in the future).

2. Feel free to assign yourself an issue as a coding challenge to fix. Note: easy to fix issues are labeled for beginners.
3. All beginner contributions to this project receive credit immediately since all issues with a beginner label contribute to the main branch. (**_NOTE_**: only assign yourself a beginner issue if you truly are one - because they are very easy to solve)
